# Bug-Out
A 2D platformer with a retro feel, Bug Out! was created during the Global Game Jam in 2019 to the theme "What does home mean to you?". 

Play as an ant being forced out of their home - an abandoned house - when humans decide to reclaim the house and move back in. Jump over platforms and avoid traps like bug spray and cans of poison, and don't stop! A vacuum is close behind to clear the "mess".
